# Unibo-Deep-Learning
This repo contains a colab notebook of the project assignment in the course Deep Learning at University of Bologna where i spent my exchange year.

The aim of the project was to build a deep generative model for generating faces with specific attribtues, using the celebA dataset. 
To tackle this we implemented a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Although VAEs generally performs worse than GANs in terms of generative performance, we chose to implement a VAE due to its probabilistic viewpoint (Variational Inference).
