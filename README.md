# Unibo-Deep-Learning
This repo contains a colab notebook of the project assignment in the course Deep Learning at University of Bologna where i spent my exchange year.

The aim of the project was to build a deep generative model for generating faces with specific attribtues, using the celebA dataset. 
To tackle this we implemented a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)
